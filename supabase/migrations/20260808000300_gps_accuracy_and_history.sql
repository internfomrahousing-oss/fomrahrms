-- G2: store the accuracy radius that comes with every fix.

-- The device reports "this point, give or take X metres". X was discarded, so
-- a +/-2000 m cell-tower estimate was stored identically to a +/-5 m satellite
-- fix and both were measured against a 150 m geofence. A within-radius verdict
-- derived from a 2 km estimate is meaningless, and a poor fix can equally place
-- someone OUTSIDE a site they are standing in.
