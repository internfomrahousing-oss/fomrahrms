-- The client now derives this from the ROLE as well as the exempt_from_timing
-- flag. The flag travels login -> UserSession -> local storage, so a session
-- created before the flag existed carries a stale false until the user signs
-- out — which is why the exemption appeared not to work even with correct data
-- and correct deployed code. Role has always been part of the session, so
-- keying on it makes the exemption immediate and immune to that staleness.
--
-- Keeping the data in step anyway, so anything reading the column directly
-- (reports, exports, a future service) agrees with the app rather than relying
-- on the same derivation being repeated correctly elsewhere.
