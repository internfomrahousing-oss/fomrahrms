-- Employee of the Month had NO approval step and raised NO notification.
-- HR wrote the row and it was live immediately — nothing ever reached
-- Management, which is why no approval notification arrived: there was no
-- flow to send one. The feature was never built, rather than broken.
--
-- Brought into line with the other Management-approved decisions: HR
-- proposes, Management approves, nothing is published until they do.
