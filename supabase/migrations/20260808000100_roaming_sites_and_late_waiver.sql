-- 1. SALES AND CRM MAY CHECK IN FROM ANY CONFIGURED SITE.
--    These roles sit at different sites through the week. Unlike Land
--    Acquisition, who are in the field with no fixed site and are exempt from
--    the geofence entirely, Sales and CRM should still be geofenced — just
--    against every site rather than one.
--
--    employee_locations was already many-to-many (unique on the PAIR), and
--    evaluateGeofence() already passes when the position is within ANY
--    assigned location, so nothing structural changed — only what is assigned.
--
--    New sites and new Sales/CRM employees are covered automatically. HR can
--    remove a site from a person afterwards and nothing re-adds it.

-- 2. LATE WAIVER — MANAGEMENT ONLY.
--    An employee must not be marked late because the app failed. Sijo reached
--    site at 09:16; his browser refused the location permission, so he could
--    not complete check-in until 09:32 — past the 09:30 Sales start.
--
--    The recorded TIME is deliberately not altered: 09:32 is when the system
--    accepted it, and overwriting that would falsify the record. The waiver
--    sits alongside, with a reason and who granted it.
