-- New Employee of the Month entries must await Management approval.
--
-- The column default was 'approved' so existing rows were not retroactively
-- unpublished when the column was added — but that default also applied to new
-- inserts, so HR's entry still went live immediately. The approval gate
-- existed and nothing had to pass through it.
alter table employee_of_month alter column status set default 'pending';

-- Belt and braces: HR must not be able to write 'approved' directly, or the
-- gate is bypassable by any client that sets the column itself. Only
-- decide_employee_of_month() (SECURITY DEFINER, Management-only) may do that.
