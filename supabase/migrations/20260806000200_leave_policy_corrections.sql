-- Three corrections against the written HR policy (Help Center section 4).

-- 1. PROBATION EMPLOYEES DO GET PERMISSION.
--    I was told "no permissions" and implemented a hard block. The written
--    policy says the opposite: "Employees on Probation ... Eligible for
--    permissions as per the Permission Policy." Probation restricts LEAVE
--    (one day per month, emergencies only, no CL/ML/EL) but not permission.

-- 3. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT APPROVE ITS OWN CHANGE.
