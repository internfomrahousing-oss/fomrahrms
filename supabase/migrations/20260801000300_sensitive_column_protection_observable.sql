-- protect_app_users_sensitive_columns() pinned protected columns back to their
-- previous value SILENTLY: the UPDATE reported success and affected rows, but
-- the new value was discarded with no error and no trace. That cost two failed
-- attempts to set work_location from a migration, each reporting success while
-- changing nothing.
--
-- It cannot simply raise instead. my_profile_page.dart has ordinary employees
-- upsert their WHOLE record (UserStore.upsertOne) just to request on-roll
-- confirmation, so a stale client legitimately re-sends protected fields;
-- raising would break employee self-service.
--
-- So: keep pinning, but make it (a) bypassable by an authorised caller via
-- app.bypass_sensitive_column_protection — which several existing migrations
-- already set, believing it worked — and (b) visible, by recording discarded
-- columns to audit_log.
--
-- The bypass flag is transaction-local and settable only from SQL or a
-- SECURITY DEFINER function; PostgREST clients cannot set it.
--
-- Note: `v_discarded || 'gross_pay'` makes Postgres parse the literal as an
-- array ("malformed array literal"); array_append() is unambiguous.
