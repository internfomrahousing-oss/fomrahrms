-- Leave entitlement depends on confirmation status.
--
--   CONFIRMED (onroll_confirmed_at set): CL, ML, EL and every other leave
--   type, plus the 120-minute permission allowance per attendance cycle.
--
--   PROBATION (onroll_confirmed_at empty): ONE leave per attendance cycle, of
--   any type, and NO permission at all.
--
-- Enforced in the database because RLS governs who may insert a row, not
-- whether they are entitled to it — the Dart checks alone are bypassable by
-- anything talking to PostgREST directly.
